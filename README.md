## Overview
We analyze and visualize a demographic and quantitative perspective on Citibike's August 2018 performance in New York City. This will shed light on our investors potential interests in Des Moines's upcoming bike-sharing start-up.

## Results

![Trip Duration](https://github.com/DenverSherman/CitiBike/blob/main/Images/1.png)

Potential for more research into desirable bike renting locations for deployment in Des Moines.

## Summary 
I included the pie chart to clearly show gender representation. I've also included a filterable starting location map with custom tooltips highlight the highest peforming locations. Altogether, the project seems worthwhile when marketed towards males.
